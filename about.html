                <p>We are a shield, a deterrent, and a force multiplier. Our name, <em>Aegis</em>, is taken from the mythological shield of Zeus — a symbol of strength, guardianship, and absolute defense. That is what we embody for every client we protect.</p>
                <p>We are not just guards. We are strategists, innovators, and defenders who anticipate threats before they arrive. From global corporations to government agencies and private individuals, our clients trust us to deliver one thing above all else: <strong>uncompromising security</strong>.</p>

                <p>Aegis Defense Solutions was founded by veterans and professionals with backgrounds spanning military operations, law enforcement, intelligence, and cybersecurity. Each founder has seen firsthand the consequences of inadequate security in high-stakes environments. We built this company to raise the standard — to move beyond reactive security and deliver proactive defense.</p>
